## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This should be done independently._

This assignment will test your understanding of creating test cases and user stories. You will identify the features required for your Project 2, and write test cases to evaluate those features. You will add as many conditional statements as are necessary for each test case, and write user stories for each conditional.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Go to the [Project 2 repo](), fork & clone it, and carefully read through the project requirements
- Identify the features you will need to build in order to satisfy the requirements
- Write a test case for each feature, consisting of as many conditionals as are necessary _(i.e. "The feature is implemented if the following conditions are true...")_
- Write a concise _**user story**_ for each conditional
- Add your test cases & user stories to the `readme.md` of your Project 2 forked repo 

**Bonus:**
- Begin planning out the custom classes (i.e. non-Android specific classes) you'll need to represent the data you'll need for your project
- Start writing the _**Unit Tests**_ that will verify your custom classes' methods work properly
- Finally, start implementing the methods for your custom classes - see if your tests pass!

#### Deliverable

Do not bother to fork _this_ repo. Instead, make a fork of the [Project 2 repo]() and do your work there. Your deliverable is a pull request to the Project 2 repo with your test cases and user stories in the `readme.md` file.
